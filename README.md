# Connected-Devices
Homework and final Project of Connected Devices
- iot-device: Python
- iot-gateway: Java

### Project 

Designed a full stack Python application on Raspberry Pi as well as a Java Gateway on laptop, using SenseHat on Raspberry Pi to
collect environmental data while implementing CoAP protocol to transfer data to the Gateway. The Gateway would then publish
these data to cloud (Ubidots) using MQTT protocol. When certain condition is met, warning emails would be sent using SMTP
protocol and SenseHat LED screen would rotate messages .
